<!-- When designing a machine learning algorithm, one of the first steps is to define how performance of the resulting algorithm will be measured. However, this step is often skimmed over, assuming it is trivial. 

Assuming you are designing an ML algorithm, the objective of this article is to get you to ask yourself the following question

_How can I best define my algorithm's performance?_

Note that this question is highly dependent on two things:

1. The problem definition
2. The intended application

A metric is a measure of performance.

### Problem Definition

Different problems require different metrics. Consider the following problems:

1. **Classification Problems**

    Classification problems 

2. **Clustering Problems**

    Clustering metrics 

### Intended Application

Since we are in the domain of _applied machine-learning_, we know that, ultimately, our algorithm needs to provide some [form of value to the end-user](algorithms-and-value).  -->
