# Introduction to Entity Resolution

Entity resolution (ER) involves the identification of data-points referring to
  the same item.
A typical example is the merging of two databases detailing the same
  information.
See [[1]](https://www.districtdatalabs.com/basics-of-entity-resolution) 
  for a more detailed problem definition.
For the academically inclined, refer to [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06397).

In order to explain why the standard metrics such as accuracy, recall and precision
  are not applicable, we need to consider

A typical approach for entity resolution, as proposed in
  [3](), involves considering

# Why Existing Metrics Are Not Representative

The _objective_ of metrics is to quantify the quality
  of an algorithm's prediction compared to a ground truth.
