<!-- In this article I will list the steps I follow when solving a problem that has a data component to it. I specifically avoided the term _machine learning_ because ML is simply a potential portion of a potential solution to the problems we are considering here.

## List of Steps

### Step 1: Define Inputs and Outputs

What will your algorithm accept as an input, and what will the output look like? Note, we are not yet considering the quality of the output, only the shape or format thereof.

### Step 2: Define Performance Metrics

Having defined the inputs and outputs, we should now define performance. Note that this has nothing to do with the way in which you intend to solve the problem. We are simply defining the desirability of various potential outputs, not _how_ we obtain them.

### Step 3: Consider Potential Solutions

Now we can consider how we want to obtain the output given an input. We could potentially consider
